Local feld potentials (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellular electrical
recordings, are a measure of the neural activity reflecting dendritic processing of
synaptic inputs to neuronal populations.
To localize synaptic dynamics it is convenient, whenever possible, to estimate the
density of trans-membrane current sources (CSD) generating the LFP.
In this work we propose a new framework, kernel Current Source Density method
(kCSD), for non-parametric estimation of CSD from LFP recorded from arbitrarily
distributed electrodes using kernel methods. We test specific implementations of this
framework on model data measured with one-, two-, and three-dimensional multi-
electrode setups. We compare these methods with the traditional approach through
numerical approximation of the Laplacian and with the recently developed inverse
Current Source Density methods (iCSD). We show that iCSD is a special case of
kCSD. The proposed method opens up new experimental possibilites of CSD anal-
ysis from already taken or new recordings on arbitrarily distributed electrodes (not
necessarily on a grid), which can be obtained in extracellular recordings of single unit
activity with multiple electrodes.
